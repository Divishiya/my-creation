                                <p>The generation gap refers to the cultural, social, and ideological differences that exist between people of different generations. These differences arise because each generation has been influenced by different experiences, events, and technologies. To be more precise, younger generations might have grown up with the internet and social media as a regular part of their lives, while older generations may have grown up without those technologies. As a result, there may be differences in values, attitudes, behaviours, and communication styles between different generations, leading to misunderstandings and conflicts.</p>

                                <p>Family values are continually shifting, with traditional and modern values coexisting in today's world. Traditionally, the definition of family has revolved around the nuclear family unit, which consists of a mother, father, and children. However, in recent years, joint families and other non-traditional family forms have become more widespread.The mixing of traditional and modern family values is a phenomenon that recognises the importance of both values in today's society.</p>
